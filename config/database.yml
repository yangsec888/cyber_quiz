# As with config/secrets.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source codedf -k
# If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url:    <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
#
production:
  <<:         *default
  database:   cyber_quiz_production
  #username:  <%= ENV['MYSQL_USER'] %>
  username:   cyber_quiz
  #password:  <%= ENV['MYSQL_TEST_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
